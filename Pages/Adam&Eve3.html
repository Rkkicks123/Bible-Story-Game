    Eve was alone, and a serpent ask's Eve "Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?" Eve replied "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, 3 but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’" <br> “You will not certainly die," the serpent said to Eve “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
